# Prime Number Checker
# Overview
Welcome to the Prime Number Checker, a simple Python script that determines whether a number is prime. 
The goal of this script is to improve myself by practicing as much as possible during my Python learning process.

# How it works
The script asks the user to enter a number. It then checks whether the number is a prime number using a simple algorithm. If the number entered is prime, it outputs "This is a prime number.". Otherwise, it displays "This is not a prime number.".

# Features
Easy to use: Just enter a number and the script does the rest.
Error handling: The script allows the user to enter an integer.
